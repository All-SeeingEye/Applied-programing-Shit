    "# Introduction - Delete\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to EE2703 Applied Programming Lab!  The purpose of the lab is to use programming concepts to implement certain concepts that you would have (or are likely to) come across in the broad domain of Electrical Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python as the programming language of choice for this course.  The pros and cons of this choice are discussed in more detail in the presentation for the course.  This Python notebook on the other hand is meant as an exercise to learn some of the operational issues regarding assignment submission and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week, the problem statement will be given out as a PDF file as well as a Python notebook.  This notebook will contain some template or stub code, as well as some parts that are to be implemented by you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain sections of the notebook will also have a \"Delete\" marked in the section heading.  These sections **should be removed by you** before submitting your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all other sections, you need to modify the text so that it is a readable document reporting your work, and add any code and results that are needed to generate a final report.  Most sections will have a description of the problem statement in *quoted* form - this part is to be removed and replaced with a description of what you have done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report will be graded based on the quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- correctness and completeness\n",
    "- aesthetics - visual quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this document consists of assignments you need to complete and submit on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook or Standalone?\n",
    "\n",
    "These assignments are created as Python notebooks, and are tested mainly on the lab server https://jup.dev.iitm.ac.in/.  The easiest way to proceed would therefore be to upload the notebook to your folder on this server, and then edit as required.  Finally, you can generate a PDF from the notebook for submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also choose to use other approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor - this has good support for editing and running Python notebooks, and can be installed locally on your laptop\n",
    "- Run a local Python jupyter server - instructions for this are readily available by searching on the internet\n",
    "- Certain other editors like PyCharm *may* also support importing and editing notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "None of the other techniques are officially supported.  You are welcome to add documentation on how to use them on the Moodle forum, but we (instructor and TAs) may not be able to help with any problems you face.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the Python notebooks on the lab server, you should be able to directly \"Save and export as\" PDF, which will run LaTeX to generate neatly formatted documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you choose one of the other approaches, you are responsible for generating your own documentation.  Future lab sessions may cover the basics of LaTeX for documentation, but in the meantime you are encouraged to learn on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that PDF generated by MS Word, Google docs, LibreOffice etc. are usually of relatively poor quality when equations and plots are to be included, and should not be used without a clear understanding of what is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit a single ZIP file for each assignment.  That file in turn should contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your python notebook(s) and/or other Python files that contain your code\n",
    "- A PDF report that contains the final documentation of your work\n",
    "- Any other figures, data, or supporting files required to generate and/or run your code"
