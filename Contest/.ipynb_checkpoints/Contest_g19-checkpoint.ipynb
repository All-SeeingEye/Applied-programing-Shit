    "* The logic we thought of is to sort the given numbers in acending order then, the numbers at the odd postions of the sorted array will make a group and numbers at even position of the sorted array will second group, the diffrence between them would be minimum as the average of two numbers at the odd position will be the number between them or close to it and hence the diffrence between the sum of odd postioned number and even position would be close to zero"
